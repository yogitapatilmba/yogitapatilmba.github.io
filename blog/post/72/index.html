We do it by having happy colleagues.<p>We are so much obsessed with this mission statement that we do not like words customers or clients, we strongly believe the word partner rightly conveys our commitment. Similarly we do not have employees we have colleagues.</p><p>When you, as a partner, engage with viditya you may not get super-human coders or rock star architects. Instead you will get completely trasparent and capable software development team which is dedicated to your success.</p><h3> The process </h3>We understand that software development has much more to it than just writing code. our team will ask you questions until they are satisfied that they have understood your vision for the project. once they think they have enough clarity they will share their understanding with you to make sure we are on same page. The team will follow the sensible agile practices to make sure you are presented with different solution options with enough details for you to take a final call for the best possible solution. Once the given solution approach is finalized the team will provide you will most realistic estimates which it will keep updating as the project moves along. One of the core guiding principles for us to be completely trasparent with our partners. So you will be informed of any roadblocks and possible threats to the proposed deadline as soon as possible so that we can work together on a mitigation plan. The team understands that you do not get paid until the product is in your users hands so the team will make sure it ships the minimum viable product as soon as possible.<h3> The people </h3>We strongly believe, trying to understand the vision of a company without understanding the people behind it is a futile exercise. People behind viditya are content. We strongly believe that though making profits if fundamental to any business, it should never be the primary driver of any business or individual. &quot;We will never try to make money off our partners without making them successful&quot;. We have learned from our own life experiences that there is great joy and happiness in helping others and what goes around comes around. Our business should not be any different. We also strongly believe that if the colleagues are happy then they will make our partners happy. We can not expect great results from people who are not happy with what they do for living. Here is an attempt to break the traditional software services mold and bring in fresh prospective.
