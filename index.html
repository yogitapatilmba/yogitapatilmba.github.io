          <p>We are so much obsessed with this mission statement that we do not like words customers or clients, we strongly
            believe the word partner rightly conveys our commitment. Similarly we do not have employees we have colleagues.

          <p>When you, as a partner, engage with viditya you may not get super-human coders or rock star architects. Instead

            We strongly believe that though making profits is fundamental to any business, it should never be the primary driver of any
            business or individual. successfully solving the end users problem should be the fundamental reason for existence
            for any business.

          <p>We have learned from our own life experiences that there is great joy and happiness in helping others and what
            goes around comes around. Our business should not be any different. We know that if the colleagues are happy
            then they will make our partners happy. We can not expect great results from people who are not happy with what
            they do for living.</p>
          <p>Here is an attempt to break the traditional software services mold and bring in fresh prospective. If you are interested

          <p>We understand that software development has much more to it than just writing code.</p>
          <p>Our team will ask you questions until they are satisfied that they have understood your vision for the project.
            Once they think they have enough clarity they will share their understanding with you to make sure we are on
            same page. The team will follow the sensible agile practices to make sure you are presented with different solution
            options with enough details for you to take a final call for the best possible solution. Once the given solution
            approach is finalized the team will provide you will most realistic estimates which it will keep updating as
            the project moves along.</p>
          <p>
            One of the core guiding principles for us to be completely transparent with our partners. So, you will be informed of any
            roadblocks and possible threats to the proposed deadline as soon as possible so that we can work together on
            a mitigation plan. The team understands that you do not get paid until the product is in your users hands so
            the team will make sure it ships the minimum viable product as soon as possible</p>
